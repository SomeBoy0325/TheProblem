# TheProblem
//Name
The Problem

//Description
This is a game based around the Trolley problem, an ethical and pyschlogical problem around the ideas of inaction versus action.
Within the game you are presented with simple questions were it is your job to decide upon an answer. Being based off the trolley problem, which is when a train is set to kill 5 people but you have the choice to change its track so it only kills one, all the questions center around this.
